    <div class="parent">
        <div class="child" style="height: auto;">
            <h3>THE NEED</h3>
            <p>According to UNICEF, there are currently 3.9 million orphans in South Africa. Without the support of parents, this orphan generation is subject 
                to extreme stigma, exploitation, neglect, disease and a host of other circumstances unseen by any previous generation. Whether on the streets 
                or heading a household at 12 years old, they are twice as likely to discontinue their schooling and twice as likely to contract HIV/AIDS. </p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="child" style="height: auto;">
            <h3>THE CALL</h3>
            <p>In 2016, the New Life Children’s Home was established as a non-profit organisation. Our aim is to provide quality care in a safe and loving 
                home for vulnerable children, irrespective of race, gender or age. We want to give children the opportunity to have a new life – filled with 
                hope, excitement, faith and love. We also want to protect and encourage all the children we help through focus on positive behaviour and Godly principles.</p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="child" style="height: auto;">
            <h3>THE ANSWER</h3>
            <p>Through research and interaction with those who are trying to solve the orphan crisis in our city, we have come up with a children’s home model that we 
                believe will make a permanent and positive change in the lives of all the children involved. We want to create a beautiful home for over 40 children – 
                a place that children can be proud of calling home. We believe this can be done best by creating a state of the art ‘container home’ with well designed and welcoming spaces.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="child" style="height: auto;">
            <h3>THE PLEDGE</h3>
            <p>As with any big project, the New Life Children’s Home is going to require funding in order to launch and run. We are very privileged to already have received land and 
                sponsorship to build a few of the homes already.  We are looking for businesses and individuals to partner with us for this great cause. Corporate donations are not 
                only tax deductible, but will also count towards the BEE spend. Together we really can make a lasting difference – bringing new life to those who need it most.</p>

                    The Yellow Home, our first residence, officially opened on September 24th, 2018! Nine people now live there, including a houseparent who has become their mother and nine children who have grown into brothers and sisters.

                    The Orange Home, our second residence, became operational on June 16th, 2019. Because this house was constructed for the "Fatherless Youth" in the city, it was Father's Day and Youth Day on this special day for us. In addition, this was the first house with a separate ground-floor disability unit. A lovely family of nine children, a house mother, and a full-time caregiver are now living in this house.
